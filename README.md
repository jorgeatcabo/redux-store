# Title
Redux Store.

# Description
As a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I want my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API.


# Installation
"npm install" and "npm run develop" for running the application.

# Usage
E-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state.

Reviewing the app’s store you find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API. Also the way the React front end accesses the store you find that the app uses a Redux provider.

WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
