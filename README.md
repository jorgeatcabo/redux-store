# Title
Redux Store.

# Description
As a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I want my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API.


# Installation
"npm install" and "npm run develop" for running the application.

# Usage
E-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state.

Reviewing the app’s store you find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API. Also the way the React front end accesses the store you find that the app uses a Redux provider.

Reviewing the way the app determines changes to its global state you find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API.

Reviewing the way the app extracts state data from the store you find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.

Reviewing the way the app dispatches actions you find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.
